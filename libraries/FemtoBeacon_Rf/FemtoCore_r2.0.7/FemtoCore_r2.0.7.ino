/**
 * When uploading, set the is_coin variable (above) to true if uploading to a coin, false if uploading to a dongle.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 
 * For this demo, plug in the dongle to one USB port, and the coin to another.
 * Use PuTTY or Minicom as serial monitor for the coin (115200 baud).
 * Use the Arduino Serial monitor for the dongle (with newline enabled, at 115200 baud, although SerialUSB doesn't do anything with the baud rate anyway).
 * 
 * Open up the Arduino Serial monitor on the dongle, and then power up the coin(s).
 * When you see "from:0x2:0x1:=INIT_COMPLETE", it means node 0x2 is ready for commands.
 * 
 * When the coin node is ready for commands, type ":v" (sends to default dest node ID) or ">v" (broadcast to all nodes) into the Arduino Serial monitor, then press enter. 
 * It should send ":v" to the coin, and the coin will return the FreeIMU version it has.
 * 
 * Initialize the RTC peripheral by running ":START_RTC"
 * Initialize the IMU by running ":1"
 * 
 * To start flow of FemtoBeacon data, type "SET_REPEAT:0x01::D" (where 0x01 enables repeat, and :D is the command to repeat)
 * To stop flow of FemtoBeacon data, type "SET_REPEAT:0x00" (where 0x00 disables repeat)
 * 
 * 
 * See COMMANDS.md for full list of commands
